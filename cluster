                                    CLUSTER
                                    =======
Cluster is a database object which contain group of table together and it shares same data block
Generally cluster are used to improve performance of the join that's why cluster are created by that's why
cluster are created by database administrator only.

Generally cluster tables must have a common column name this common column is also called as cluster key.

In all relational databases when ever we are submitting inner join or outer join then database server first,
check from clause tables are available cluster or not
When ever those table are available in cluster then database server very fastly retrieve data from cluster,
table

Generally in all relational database cluster are created at the time of table creation 
In oracle we are creating cluster by using flowing three step process.

step1:-create a cluster.

step2:-create an index on cluster.

step3:-create actual tables.


step1:-create a cluster:-
       ================
       In oracle we are creating cluster based on common column name this common column is also called as 
       cluster key 
Syntax:-
------
create cluster clustername(commmoncolname datatype(size));


step2:-create an index on cluster:-
       ========================== 
Syntax:-
------
create index indexname on cluster clustername;

step3:-create actual tables:-
       ==================== 
syntax:-
------
create table tablename(col1 datatype(size),col2 datatype(size),.....)cluster clustername(commoncolname);

Example:-
--------
sql>create cluster emp_dept(deptno numbr(10));
sql>create index abcd on cluster emp_dept;

sql>create table e1(empno number(10),ename varchar(10),sal number(10),deptno number(10))cluster emp_dept(deptno);

sql>create table d1(deptno number(10),dname varchar2(10),loc varchar2(10)) cluster emp_dept(deptno);

sql>desc e1;
sql>desc d1;

note:
----
Generally cluster table having same rowid.
Example:-
-------
sql>insert into e1 values(1,'abc',2000,10);

sql>select * from e1;

| EMPNO | ENAME | SAL  | DEPTNO |
|-------+-------+------+--------|
| 1     | abc   | 2000 | 10     |

sql>insert into d1 values(10,'sw','hyd');

sql>select * from d1;

| DEPTNO | DNAME | LOC |
|--------+-------+-----|
| 10     | SW    | HYD |

sql>select rowidfrom e1;
sql>select rowid from d1;

(here these rowids are same)
