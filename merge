MERGE
=====>
Merge is a dml statement introduce in oracle 9i merge statement is used to transfer data from
source table into target table when both table structure are same.
Generally merge statement used in datawarehousing applications
Merge statement is also called as upsert statement because in merge statement we are using update,insert
command conditionally 

SYNTAX:
merge into targettablename using sourcetablename on(join condition)when matched then update set targettablecolumnname1=sourcetabecolumnname1,.......when not matched then insert(targettablecolumnnames)values(sourcetablecolumnnames);

sql>select * from dept;(target table)
sql>create table depts as select * from dept;
sql>insert into depts values(1,'a','b');
sql>select * from depts;

sql>merge into dept d using depts s on(d.deptno=s.deptno)when matched then update set d.dname=s.dname,d.loc=s.loc when not matched then insert(d.deptno,d.dname,d.loc)values(s.deptno,s.dname,s.loc);
sql>select * from dept;

note:
THrough the merge statement we can not update on clause column [on clause==joing condition]
note:
oracle 10G onwards we can also used delete statement witin merge command this delete statement must be used.
along with update statement by using following SYNTAX

systax:

delete where condition

whenever we are using this delete statement then oracle server automatically delete target table data.
example:
sql>MERGE into dept d using depts s on(d.deptno=s.deptno)when matched then update set d.dname=s.dname,d.loc=s.loc delete where loc='DALLAS' when not matched then insert (d.deptno,d.dname,d.loc)values(s.deptno,s.dname,s.loc);

sql>select * from dept;
