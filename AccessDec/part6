jdbc API access requirement spacification to develop data base driver
database vender is responsible to implement this jdbc API.

1:from client point of view an interface define the set of services what he is expecting

2:from service provider point of view an interface define the set of services what he is offering hence any 
  contruct between  client and service provider is consider as an interface.

Example:
--------
thourgh bank atm GUI screen bank people are highlighting the set of  services what they are offering at 
same time the same GUI screen represent the set of services what customer is expecting hence this Gui scree-n access contruct between customer and bank people

Defination3:
-----------
Inside interface every method is always abstract whether we are declare or not 
hence interface is considerd as 100% pure abstract class 

summary defination:-

Any service requirement spacification or any contruct between client and service provider or 100% pure abstract class
is nothing but interface 

1:When Ever we are implementing an interface for each and every method of that interface we have to provide 
implementation otherwise we have to declare class as abstract then next level child class is responsible 
to provide implementation 

2:Every interface method is always public and abstract whether we declareing or not hence whenever we are
implementing an interface method compulsory we should declare as public otherwise we will get compile error

Example:
    
interface Interf
{
    void m1();
    void m2();
    }
abstract class serviceprovider implement Interf
{
    public void m1()
    {
    }
}
class SubServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public void m2()
    {
    }
}

                           Extends Vs Implements:-
                           ---------------------

1:A class can extends only one class at a time
2:An interface can extends any number of interfaces simultaneously
    Example:
        interface A | interface B
        {           | {
                    |
        }           |}
interface C extends A,B
{

}
A class can implement any number of interfaces simultaneously 

A class can extends another class and can implement any number of interfaces simultaneously

class A extends B implements C,D,E
{

}

which of the following is valid.

1:A class can extends any number of classes at a time[invalid]
2:A class can implement only one interface at a time[invalid]

3:Interface can extends only one interface at time [invalid]
4:An interface can implement any number of interfaces simultaneously[invalid] 

5:A class can extends other class or can implement an interface but not both simultaneously [invalid]
6:None of the above[True]

consider the following expression
      +-------------+
      | X extends Y |
      +-------------+
which of the following possibility of the above expression is valid

        1:both x and y should be classes.[invalid]
        2:both x and y should be interfaces.[invalid]
        3:both x and y either classes or interface[valid]
+-----------+
|x extends y|
+-----------+
+-------------+
|x extends y,z|
+-------------+
x,y,z should be interface
+----------------+
|x implement y,z |
+----------------+
x-->class 
y,z--->interface
+------------------------+
|x extends y implement z |
|
+------------------------+
x,y --->classes
z ------->interface
+----------------------------+
|x implement y extends z     |
+----------------------------+
CE:-because we have to take extends first followed by interface

Interface method:-
=================
Every method present inside a interface is always public and abstract whethere we are declaring or not

                               interface Interf
                                      {
                           +------void m1();
                           |          }
                           |
                           |
                           +--public :To make this method available to every implementation class.
                           |                                                                      
                           |                                                                      
                           |                                                                      
                           |                                                                      
                           +---abstract:Implementation class is responsible to provide implementation.                                                                  
hence inside interface the following method declaration are equal 
        
        void m1();
        public void m1();
        abstract void m1();
        public abstract void m1();
As Every interface method is always public and abstract we can't declare interface method with the followin-g modifier private
            protected

            static 
            final
            synchronized
            strictfp
            native
which of the following method declaration are allowed inside interface


        public void m1()==>invalid[because of semicoln]
        private void m1();==>invalid
        protected void m1();==>invalid
        static void m1();==>invalid
        public abstract native void m1();==>invalid
        abstract public void m1();==>valid

An interface can cantain variables the main purpose of interface variable is to define requirement level 
constant

Every interface variable is always public,static ,final whether we are declaring or not.

                    interface Inter
                    {
                   +--->int x = 10;
                   |
                   |    }
                   |     
                   +-->public:To make this variable available to every implementation class.  
                   |     
                   |     
                   |     
                   +-->static:Withou existing object implementation class has to access this variable  
                   |
                   |
                   |
                   +-->final:if one implementation class change value then remaining implementation class 
                             will be effected To restrict this every interface  variable is always final.

hence within the interface the following declaration are equal.

            int x=10;
            public int x =10;
            static int x = 10;

            final int x = 10;
            public static int x = 10;
            public final int x = 10;
            static final int x = 10;
            public static final int x = 10;
As Every interface variable is always public,static,final we can't declare with the follwing modifiers.

            private
            protected
            transient
            volatile

for interface variable compusory we should perform intialization at the time of declaration.otherwise,
we will get compile time error.

example:

interface Inter
{
    int x ;
    }Error:equal symbol expected.

inside interface which of the following variable declaration is allowed.

            int x;[invalid
            private int x =10;[invalid
            protected int x = 10;[invalid
            volatile int x = 10;[invalid
            transient int x = 10;[invalid]
            public static int x = 10;[valid]

inside implementation class we can access interface variable but we can't modifiy values 

Example:-
--------
interface Inter
{
    int x = 10;
    }
class Test implements Inter
{
    public static void main(String[]args)
    {
        x = 777;'here we are using variable of Interface variable'
        }
        }Error:can not assing value to final variable.

2:

class Test implements Inter
{
    public static void main(String[]args)
    {
        int x = 777;'here we are declaring variable not using'
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

interface naming conflit:-
========================

1:method naming conflit:

case1:
    if two interfaces contain a method with same signature[method name] and same return type then in the,
    implementation class we have to provide implementation for only one method 

Example:-
-------
    interface left        | interface right
    {                     |  {
        public void m1(); |     public void m1();
        }                 |     }
                          |
class Test implements left,righ
{
    public void m1()
    {

    }

    }
case2:
    if two interfaces contain a method with same name but different argument types then in the implementatio    n  for both method and these method access overloaded.  
Example:-
-------
interafce left            | interface right
{                         |  {
    public void m1();     |     public void m1(int n);
    }                     |   }

class Test implements left,right
{
    public void m1();
    {

    }
    public void m1(int i)
    {

    }
 }

case3:
    if two interfaces contain method with same signature but different return return types then it is,
    imposible to implement both interfaces simultaneously[if return type are not covarient]

Example:-
--------

interface left                  interface right
{                               {
    public void m1();            public int m1();
    }                           }
We can't write any java class which implement both interface simultaneously  

Q:Is a java class can implement any number of interfaces simultaneously
Yes except a particular case if two interfaces contains a method with same signature but different return
then it is imposible to implement both interfaces simultaneously

Interface Variable nameing confilit:-
-----------------------------------
Two interfaces can contain a variable with the same name and there may be a chance of variable naming confilits But we can solve this problem by using interface names 

Example:-
--------

interface Left              interface right
{                           {
    x = 777;                    x = 888;
    }                         }

class Test implements Left,right;
{
    public static void main(String[]args)
    {
        System.out.println(x);Error:ambiguous
        System.out.println(Left.x)==>777;
        System.out.println(right.x)==>888;
        }
   }
                               *****************    
                          *****Marker Interface *****
                               *****************    

If an interface doesn't contain any method and by implementing that interface if our object will get some abillity
such type of interfaces are called marker interfaces.

Example:-
--------               |
1:Serialidable(I)      |
2:cloneable(I)         |These are marked for some ability
3:RandomAccess(I)      |
4:SingleThreadmodel(I) |

Example1:
--------
By implementing serialidable interface out object can be saved to the file and can travel across the network

Example2:
--------
By implementing cloneable interface our object in postion to produced exactly duplicate clone object.

Q:Without having any method how the object will get some abilities in marked interfaces
To reduced complexity of programmming and to make java language as simple

Q:is it possible to create our own marker interface.
Yes but customization of JVM is required 
--------

Adapter class:-
=============
Adapter class is a simple java class that implements an interface with only empty implementation 

EXample:-
--------
interface X            | class Adapter implements X
{                      |  {
    m1();              |  m1(){}
    m2()               |  m2(){}
    m3();              |  m3(){}
    .                  |   .
    .                  |   .
    .                  |   .
    .                  |   .
    m1000();           |   m1000(){}
    }                  |

If we implement an  interface for each and every method of that interface compulsory we should provide implementation
whether it is required or not required

class Test implements X
{
    m3()
    {
       10 lines only need
    }
    m1(){}
    m2(){}
    m3(){}
    .
    .
    .
    .
    m1000(){}

The problem in this approach it increases length of the code reduced readiabilite we can solve this problem by using
adapter classes Instead of implementing interface if we extends adapter class we have to provide implementation only
for required method and we are not responsible to provide implementation  for each and every method of the interface
so that length of the code will reduced

class Test extends Adapter x
{
    m3()
    {
    -----
    -----
    ------
    -------
    }
    } 
class simple extends Adapter X
{
    m7()
    {



    }
}
class Demo extends Adapter
{
    m1000()
    {
   ---- 
   -----
    }
}


we can develop a servlet in the fllowing three ways.

1:By implementing servlet.
2:By extending Generic servlet
3:By extending HttpServlet


                                               servlet(I)
                               --------------> |
                              /                |
                             /                 |
              *******       /                  |
            **       **    /                   |
          **MyServlet  **--------------------> Generic servlet(Ac)
          *             */                     |
          **           **\                     |
            **       **   \                    |
              *******      \                   |
                            \                  |
                             ----------------> HttpServlet(Ac)

if we implement servlet interface for each and every method of that interface we should provide implementation it 
increases length of  the code and reduced readabilities
Instead of implementing servlet interface directly if we extends Generic servlet we have to provide implementation 
Only for service method and all remaining method we are not required to provide implementation 

Hence more or less Genric servlet access adapter class for servlet interface 

Marker interface and adapter classes simplify complixity of progamming  and these are best utilities to the programmer
and programmer life will become simple 


Interface Vs Abstract class Vs concrete class: 
=============================================
1:If we don't know anything about implementation just we have requirement specification then we should go for interface 
Example:
    servlet
2:If we are talking about implementation but not completely [partial implementation] then we should go for abstract
class 
Example:
    GenericServlet,httpservlet
3:If we are talking about implementation completely and ready to provide service then we should go for concrete class
Example:-
    MyownServlet

Difference between interface and abstract class:-
===============================================
1:If we don't know any thing about implementation and just we have requirement specification then we should go interface

2:If we are talking about implementation but not completely [partial implementation]then we should go for abstract class

3:Inside interface Every method is always public and abstract whethere we are declaring or not hence interface is 
considerd as 100% pure abstract class 

4:If method present inside abstract class need not be public and abstract and we can tak concrete method also

5:As Every interface method always public and abstract and hence we can't declare with the following modifiers
private,protected,final,static,synchronized,native and strictfp

6:There are no restrictation on abstact class method modifiers 

7:Every variable present inside interface is always public static final whethere we are declaring or not

8:Every variable present inside abstract class need not be public,static,final
9:As Every interface variable is always public,static,final we can't declare with the following modifiers 
private,protected,volatile,transient

10:There are no retriction on abstract class variable modifiers
11:For interface variable compulsory we should perform intialization at the time of declaration only otherwise we willget compile time error

12:For abstract class variables we are not required to perform intialization at the time of declaration  
13:Inside interface we can't declare static and instance block
14:Inside abstract class we can declare static and instance blocks

15:Inside interface we can't declare constructors 
16:Inside abstract class we can declare constructor 

Q)Anyway we can't create object for abstract class But abstract class can contain constructor what is the need?

Abstract class constructor will be executed whenever we are creating child class object to perform intialization off
child class object

Aproach1:
without having constructor in abstract class.
class student extends Parent
{                                             | class Teacher extends Parent
    int rollno;                               |  {
    Student(String name,int age,......)       |     String subject;
    {                          100 properties |     Teacher(String name,int age,...)
        this.name = name;   |                 |           {
        this.age  = age;    |                 |             this.name = name;

        this.rollno = rollno|                 |             .
    }                                         |             .

                                  |           |      Teacher t2 = new Teacher(101,properties)

with constructor inside abstract class.

note1:
Either directly or indirectly we can't create object for abstract class 

Anyway we can't create object for abstract class and interface but abstract class can constructor but interface dosn't
contain constructor what is the reason?
The main purpose of constructor is to perfrom initialization for instance variable abstract class can contain instance
variable which are required for child object to perfrom intialization of those instance variable constructor is requir-ed for abstract class

But Every variable present inside interface is always public,static,final whethere we are declaring or not and there 
is no chance of existing  instance variable inside interface hence constructor concept is not required for interface.

When ever we are creaing child class object parent object won't be created just parent class constructor will be execu-ed for child object purpose only

Example:
--------
class P
{
    P()
    {
        System.out.println(this.hashCode());
        }
   }
class C extends P
{
    C()
    {
        System.out.println(this.hashCode());
        }
    }
class Test
{
    public static void main(String[]args)
    {
        C c = new C();
        System.out.println(c.hashCode());
    }
 }

Inside interface every method is always abstract and we can take only abstract method in abstract class also then 
what is the difference between interface and abstract class i.e Is it posible to replace interface with abstract class

ans:we can replace interface with abstract class but it is not good programming practice this is something like 
requreting IAS officer for swiping activity 
If everything abstract then it is highly recomended to go for interface but not for abstract class

Approach1:
    
    abstract class X      | interface X
    {                     |  {
    ----                  |     
    ----                  |    }
    }                     | class Test implement X
    class Test extends X  |   {
    {                     |
    -----                 |   }
    -----                 |   Test t = new Test();
    }                     |
                          |
  Test t = new Test();    |
  more time taking        |     less time taking 
                          |
1:While extending abstract| 1: While implementing interface we can extend some other class
class it is not possible  |  and hence we wan't miss any inheritance benifit
to extends any other class|
and hence we are missing  |
inheritance benifit       |
                          |
2:In this case object crea|  2:In this case ojbect creating is not costly 
-ting is very costly      |    Test t = new Test();
Test t = new Test();      |      +-----+
   +-----+                |      |2sec |
   |2min |                |      +-----+
   +-----+                |
